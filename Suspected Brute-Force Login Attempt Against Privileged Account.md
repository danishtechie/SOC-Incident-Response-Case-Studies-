Incident ID: IR-002
Category: Authentication Security
Severity: High
Status: Closed
Environment: Simulated SOC
Date: Simulated Case Study

1. Executive Summary

A spike in failed authentication attempts targeting a privileged account triggered a high-severity alert. The frequency and consistency of the failures strongly suggested a brute-force attack. An investigation was conducted to determine whether the account had been compromised and to assess potential risk.

2. How the Alert Was Detected

The alert was generated by an authentication monitoring rule that detects repeated login failures within a short timeframe. Privileged accounts are closely monitored due to their elevated access level.

3. Log & Evidence Review
Key Log Entry

Event ID: 4625  
Account Name: admin  
Failure Reason: Invalid credentials  
Source IP: 192.168.1.50  
Logon Type: 3 (Network)

What Stood Out:

Multiple failed attempts in rapid succession

Targeting of a privileged account

All attempts originated from the same IP address

4. Investigation Details

To assess the risk, the following steps were taken:

Reviewed authentication logs before and after the alert window

Verified whether any successful login followed the failures

Checked for similar activity against other accounts

The investigation confirmed that all attempts failed and no account access was gained.

5. Impact Assessment

No unauthorized access occurred. However, the nature of the activity posed a significant risk due to the account being targeted.

6. Response Actions

The source IP was blocked within the simulated environment

A password reset was recommended for the affected account

Account lockout policies were reviewed

7. Lessons Learned

This case highlighted the importance of strong monitoring for privileged accounts and the value of enforcing account lockout and multi-factor authentication controls.

8. Final Outcome

The brute-force attempt was detected early and contained without impact. The incident was documented and closed.
