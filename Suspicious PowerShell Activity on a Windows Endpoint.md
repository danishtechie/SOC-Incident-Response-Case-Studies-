INCIDENT 01
Suspicious PowerShell Activity on a Windows Endpoint

Incident ID: IR-001
Category: Endpoint Security
Severity: Medium
Status: Closed
Environment: Simulated SOC / Home Lab
Date: Simulated Case Study

1. Executive Summary

An alert was raised after PowerShell was executed with encoded command-line arguments on a Windows endpoint. Encoded PowerShell usage is commonly seen in malware execution and post-exploitation activity, so the alert was treated as potentially malicious. The endpoint was investigated using process execution logs and supporting telemetry. No persistence or further malicious activity was identified, and the incident was closed after validation.

2. How the Alert Was Detected

The alert was generated by endpoint monitoring rules designed to flag suspicious PowerShell usage, specifically the presence of Base64-encoded commands. This behavior is unusual for standard user activity and often indicates an attempt to obscure command intent.

3. Log & Evidence Review
Key Log Entry

Event ID: 4688  
Process Name: powershell.exe  
Command Line: powershell.exe -enc SQBFAFgAIAAoAE4AZQB3...  
Parent Process: explorer.exe  
User: WORKSTATION01\User01

What Stood Out:

The use of the -enc flag suggested deliberate command obfuscation.

The process was launched under a standard user context.

No approved scripts or scheduled tasks were expected at that time.

4. Investigation Details

The investigation focused on understanding whether this activity was part of a broader compromise. The following checks were performed:

Reviewed the full process tree to identify suspicious child processes

Checked common persistence locations, including registry run keys

Reviewed network activity around the execution time

Validated whether similar activity occurred on other endpoints

No additional indicators of compromise were found.

5. Impact Assessment

The activity was contained to a single endpoint. There was no evidence of lateral movement, data access, or network-based command-and-control communication.

6. Response Actions

The PowerShell process was terminated

The endpoint was monitored for recurring behavior

Additional logging recommendations were documented

7. Lessons Learned

This incident reinforced the importance of command-line visibility for scripting engines. Encoded PowerShell commands should always be reviewed with priority, even when no immediate damage is observed.

8. Final Outcome

The alert was confirmed as a suspicious but non-persistent activity within a controlled environment. The case was closed after validation and documentation.
