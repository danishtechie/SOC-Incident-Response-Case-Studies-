Login Activity from an Unusual Location

Incident ID: IR-003
Category: Identity & Access Management
Severity: Medium
Status: Closed
Environment: Simulated SOC
Date: Simulated Case Study

1. Executive Summary

An alert was triggered after a user successfully logged in from a geographic location not previously associated with their account. Since unusual login locations can indicate account compromise, the activity was investigated to determine whether it was legitimate or malicious.

2. How the Alert Was Detected

The alert was generated by an anomaly-based rule that flags logins from new or rare geographic regions for a given user.

3. Log & Evidence Review
Key Log Entry:
Event ID: 4624  
Account Name: user02  
Logon Type: 10 (Remote Interactive)  
Source IP: 203.0.113.25  
Location: Unusual region


What Stood Out:

First login from this region

Successful authentication

Login occurred outside normal working hours

4. Investigation Details

The investigation focused on validating the legitimacy of the login:

Reviewed historical login patterns for the user

Checked for concurrent or impossible travel scenarios

Monitored post-login activity for abnormal behavior

The activity aligned with expected user behavior within the simulated scenario.

5. Impact Assessment

No indicators of compromise were identified. The account activity was determined to be legitimate.

6. Response Actions

User verification was completed (simulated)

The session was monitored for additional activity

No containment actions were required

7. Lessons Learned

Anomaly-based alerts are effective but require careful validation to avoid false positives. Contextual awareness is critical in identity-related investigations.

8. Final Outcome

The alert was validated as benign after investigation and the case was closed with no further action required.
