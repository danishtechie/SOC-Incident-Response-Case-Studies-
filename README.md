# SOC-Incident-Response-Case-Studies-

Overview

This repository contains a curated set of incident response case studies created to demonstrate my practical skills in SOC alert triage, log analysis, investigation, and incident documentation.

All cases are based on simulated security incidents generated within controlled training and home-lab environments. The focus of this portfolio is not the tooling itself, but how alerts are analyzed, validated, and documented using real SOC workflows.

What This Repository Demonstrates

Through these case studies, I demonstrate the ability to:

Perform alert triage and severity assessment

Analyze endpoint and authentication logs

Distinguish between true positives and false positives

Conduct structured incident investigations

Document findings in a clear, professional SOC format

Communicate technical findings in a way suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders

Incident Case Studies Included
1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity on a Windows Endpoint

Category: Endpoint Security

Focus Areas:

Process execution analysis

Encoded PowerShell command detection

Endpoint investigation and containment

Outcome:

Activity investigated and validated

No persistence or lateral movement identified

2. Suspected Brute-Force Login Attempt

Category: Authentication Security

Focus Areas:

Failed login pattern analysis

Privileged account monitoring

Attack validation and escalation decisions

Outcome:

Brute-force attempt detected and contained

No unauthorized access observed

3. Login from an Unusual Geographic Location

Category: Identity & Access Management

Focus Areas:

Anomalous login detection

User behavior analysis

False-positive validation

Outcome:

Activity confirmed as legitimate

Alert closed after verification

Approach & Methodology

Each incident follows a structured SOC-style workflow:

Alert detection and initial triage

Log and evidence analysis

Investigation and correlation

Impact assessment

Response and mitigation actions

Lessons learned and closure

Log excerpts included in the reports are sanitized and minimal, focusing on relevant fields rather than raw data dumps.

Tools & Concepts Referenced

While specific vendor tools are intentionally abstracted, the investigations are based on concepts and data commonly found in SOC environments, including:

Windows Security Event Logs

Endpoint process creation events

Authentication and access logs

SIEM alerting and correlation logic

Incident severity classification

Important Note on Data Authenticity

All incidents, logs, and scenarios in this repository were generated within simulated environments for training and demonstration purposes only.
No production, enterprise, or customer data is included.

This portfolio is intended to demonstrate analytical thinking, investigative approach, and documentation quality, not access to real organizational systems.

About Me

I am an aspiring SOC Analyst (L1) with hands-on experience in log analysis, incident triage, and security monitoring through structured training and home-lab practice. I actively focus on building job-ready skills aligned with real SOC operations and continuously improving my defensive security knowledge.
